# Core Models

This directory contains the core data models used throughout the application:

- `Restaurant.swift` - Restaurant entity model
- `MenuItem.swift` - Menu item model with customizations
- `Order.swift` - Order entity and status models
- `User.swift` - User profile and preferences
- `Cart.swift` - Shopping cart models

These models should be framework-agnostic and contain only business logic.
